This project is interesting because although it uses some knowledge I've learned from a while ago, it puts together many peices of the puzzle to create a fun, interactive art project, which plays with ellipse size. In this project, I used variables and the draw function to make this peice come to frutition. Despite simplicity of the code, the concept to make something so distorted, which counter-intuitive modulation, took a while to plan. I used many concept maps to come up with this concept. I updated many of the documentation to keep it up-to-date and edited the contituents of the draw fucntion to make this peice shine. Very enjoyable project!
